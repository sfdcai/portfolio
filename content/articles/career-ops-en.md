    A multi-agent system built with Claude Code that automates the job search: scores offers multi-dimensional (A-F), generates ATS-optimized PDFs per offer, fills forms via Playwright, and batch-processes with parallel workers. HITL design: AI analyzes, I decide. Open source under MIT — 49.3K+ stars, 3,500+ on Discord.
manifesto: |
    Companies use AI to filter candidates. I just gave candidates AI to choose companies.
metaCallout: |
    The irony: I built a multi-agent system to search for multi-agent roles. The system demonstrated the competencies better than any interview could. And no, it is not gaming the system: Career-Ops automates analysis, not decisions.
closingCallback: |
    The system proved what no interview could: in the AI era, what you build with AI is the resume that gets you hired.

  intro:
    hook: |
        I built an AI system to search for a job. It worked — I am now Head of Applied AI. Then I published it on GitHub and it exploded: 49.3K+ stars, viral, articles in France, China, and Korea. Week one of my AI job search was all manual. By week two I had stopped applying — I was building Career-Ops.
    body: |
        631 evaluations later, Career-Ops was filtering better than I was. An AI-powered job search tool built as a multi-agent system: reads job descriptions, scores them multi-dimensional, generates personalized resumes, and prepares applications. I reviewed and decided. The AI did the analytical work. The system demonstrated exactly the competencies the target roles required — and that did not go unnoticed.
  theProblem:
    heading: "Why Did I Need to Automate My Job Search?"
    body: |
        Searching for senior AI engineering roles is a full-time job in itself. Each offer requires reading the JD, mapping your skills against requirements, adapting the CV, writing personalized responses, and filling 15-field forms. Multiply that by 10 offers per day.
    painPoints:
      - label: Repetitive reading.
        detail: 70% of offers are a poor fit. You find out after reading 800 words of JD.
      - label: Generic CVs.
        detail: A static PDF cannot highlight the proof points relevant to each specific offer.
      - label: Manual forms.
        detail: |
            Every platform asks the same questions in different formats. Copy-paste 15 times per application.
      - label: No tracking.
        detail: |
            Without a system, you forget where you applied. Duplicate effort or lose follow-up entirely.
      - label: Zero feedback.
        detail: "Apply, wait, and never know if the problem was fit, the CV, or timing."
      - label: Global market.
        detail: |
            The AI sector moves internationally. Local referrals do not scale when you apply to companies across 6 different countries.
    punchline: The work is not hard. It is repetitive. And repetitive work gets automated.
  architecture:
    heading: "How Does the Multi-Agent System Work?"
    body: |
        Career-Ops is not a script or an auto-apply bot. It is a multi-agent system with 12 operational modes, each a Claude Code skill file with its own context, rules, and tools. An agent that reasons about the problem domain and executes the right action.
    whyModes:
      heading: "Why Modes, Not One Prompt"
      items:
        - label: Precise context.
          detail: |
              Each mode loads only the information it needs. auto-pipeline skips contact rules. apply skips scoring logic.
        - label: Testability.
          detail: One mode gets tested in isolation. Changing PDF logic never touches evaluation.
        - label: Independent evolution.
          detail: |
              Adding a new mode never breaks existing ones. Training mode shipped 3 weeks after first deploy.
    modes:
      - name: auto-pipeline

  scoring:
    heading: "How Does Career-Ops Evaluate Each Job Offer?"
    body: |
        My private pre-launch rubric had 10 weighted sub-axes (shown in the table). When I open-sourced career-ops on April 4, 2026, I consolidated these into **6 categorical dimensions** for the public tool. This page documents the framework I used to evaluate 631 offers in March 2026 — the canonical current rubric lives at [career-ops.org/methodology](https://career-ops.org/methodology). Output is always a numeric score (1-5) and an A-F grade.

      details: |
          Fault-tolerant: a worker failure never blocks the rest. Lock file prevents double execution. Batch is resumable — reads state and skips completed items.

    heading: "How Does Career-Ops Generate a Personalized Resume?"
    body: |
        A generic CV loses. Career-Ops works as an AI resume builder that generates a different ATS-optimized resume for each offer, injecting JD keywords and reordering experience by relevance. Not a template: a resume built from real CV proof points.
    steps:
      - label: Extract 15-20 keywords from the JD.
        detail: "Keywords land in the summary, first bullet of each role, and skills section."

      body: |
          When I no longer needed Career-Ops, I published it on GitHub. In one week it went from private repo to viral — 35K stars, 5K forks, and articles in blogs from France, China, and Korea by people who had never heard of me. Today it has crossed 48K stars and a community of 3K+ people on Discord helps each other configure and adapt the system. The project ended up demonstrating more competencies than any hiring process could.

    heading: Lessons
    items:
      - title: "Automate analysis, not decisions"
        detail: |
            Career-Ops evaluates 631 offers. I decide which ones get my time. HITL is not a limitation — it is the design. AI filters noise, humans provide judgment.
      - title: Modes beat a long prompt
        detail: |
            12 modes with precise context outperform a 10,000-token system prompt. Each mode loads only what it needs. Less context means better decisions.
      - title: Dedup is more valuable than scoring
        detail: |
            680 deduplicated URLs mean 680 evaluations I never had to repeat. Dedup saves more time than any scoring optimization.
      - title: "A CV is an argument, not a document"
        detail: |
            A generic PDF convinces nobody. A CV that reorganizes proof points by relevance, injects the right keywords, and adapts framing to the archetype — that CV converts.
      - title: "Batch over sequential, always"
        detail: |
            Batch mode with parallel workers processes 122 URLs while I do something else. The investment in parallel orchestration pays off on the first run.
      - title: The system IS the portfolio
        detail: |
            Building a multi-agent system to search for multi-agent roles is the most direct proof of competence. I do not need to explain that I can do this — I am using it.
      - title: Open-source it when you no longer need it
        detail: |
            Career-Ops was private while I was using it. When I got the job, I published it. One week later it had 49.3K stars. The lesson: the best time to open-source a project is when it has already proven its value in real production.
      - title: Why I keep it MIT
        detail: |
            MIT license. No dark patterns, no upsell inside the CLI, no feature gating. If it works for you, it works. If you want to support the maintenance or join the community, you can. But the tool does not depend on it.

faq:
  heading: FAQ
  items:
    - q: "Is this gaming the system?"
      a: |
          Career-Ops automates analysis, not decisions. Real funnel from my March 2026 search: 631 listings evaluated → 66 applications sent → 12 interview processes → 1 offer signed (Head of Applied AI). The system discarded the 565 that did not fit; the 66 that did, I read one by one before applying and reviewed every PDF before sending. Same philosophy as a CRM or an IDE: the system organizes, the human decides.
    - q: "Why Claude Code and not a script pipeline?"
      a: |
          A script cannot reason. Career-Ops adapts scoring based on company context (size, stack mentioned in the JD, AI maturity signals), reformulates CV keywords for each offer without fabricating experience, and generates narrative reports with inline justification instead of tables with filled cells. The logic of each of the 12 modes lives in its own Claude Code skill file with isolated context and rules; adding a new mode does not require rewriting the rest of the pipeline.
    - q: "What does it cost to run?"
      a: |
          Zero marginal cost per evaluation. Career-Ops runs on my Claude Max 20x plan ($200/mo), which I use for everything: portfolio sfdcai.github.io/portfolio, LLMOps chatbot, blog articles, Life OS, and Career-Ops. 631 listing evaluations + 354 ATS-optimized PDFs generated without a single extra invoice. With Claude Pro ($20/mo) it also works for lower volume — the real limit is the plan usage window, not per-call cost.
    - q: "Does the apply mode fill forms automatically?"
      a: |
          It reads the page with Playwright, retrieves the cached evaluation, and generates coherent responses matching the scoring. I review before submitting — always.
    - q: "What happens when the scanner finds a duplicate?"
      a: |
          scan-history.tsv stores 680 seen URLs. Dedup by exact URL match plus normalized company+role match against applications.md. Zero re-evaluations.
    - q: "Is it replicable?"
      a: |
          Yes — it is open source. The official landing is career-ops.org (docs, AI chat and guides) and the code lives at github.com/sfdcai/career-ops. Requires Claude Code with Playwright access. Skill files define the logic for each mode. 37K+ people have already seen, forked, or adapted it.
    - q: "How do I use Career-Ops?"
      a: |
          Career-Ops is a local tool that runs from your terminal with Claude Code. Clone the repository, configure your resume and preferences, and launch modes as needed: auto-pipeline to evaluate an offer end-to-end, scan to discover offers on job boards, batch to process many URLs in parallel, or pdf to generate a personalized resume. Everything runs on your machine — your resume and personal data never leave your computer. If you need help, a community of 1,000+ people is on Discord: discord.gg/8pRpHETxa4
    - q: "What do I need to run Career-Ops?"
      a: |
          Claude Code with a plan that includes tool access (Claude Max or Claude Pro). Playwright for web navigation. Node.js for utility scripts like tracker merging and PDF generation with Puppeteer. A working directory with your resume in markdown and your search preferences. No servers, databases, or external APIs needed — everything runs locally. The Discord community (discord.gg/8pRpHETxa4) can help with setup.
    - q: "What kind of AI does Career-Ops use?"
      a: |
          Career-Ops is not a chatbot or an API wrapper. It is a multi-agent system where Claude Code acts as the brain: it reasons about each offer, evaluates fit against your profile multi-dimensional (canonical rubric at career-ops.org/methodology), and makes filtering decisions. Each of the 12 modes is a skill file with its own context and rules. Web navigation uses Playwright. PDFs use Puppeteer. Batch processing launches parallel workers in tmux. No fine-tuning or custom models — standard Claude with very precise context.
    - q: "Who created Career-Ops?"
      a: |
          I did — Amit Bhardwaj (sfdcai). I built it for my own AI job search after spending 16 years founding and selling a phone repair business. The system evaluated 631 offers and helped me land my current role as Head of Applied AI. When I no longer needed it, I published it as open source. In one week it reached 49.3K+ GitHub stars. The Discord community is now 3,500+ people: discord.gg/8pRpHETxa4
