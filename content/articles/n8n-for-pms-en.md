  subtitle: |
      Practical cheat sheet: automate your sprint reports and classify feedback with AI using n8n workflows — no code required. 2 free importable templates.
  date: "Feb 24, 2026"
intro:
  hook: "How many hours a week do you spend on work that has nothing to do with product?"
  body: |
      I tracked mine. It was twenty. Some weeks, thirty. Sprint reports that take a full day. Feedback scattered across five tools that I had to read, classify, and turn into tickets one by one. Status updates typed from scratch every Monday.
  punchline: |
      I wasn't a product manager. I was a very expensive data router. Moving information between tools that should have been talking to each other. I spent 170 hours a month on this at my own company before I automated all of it. Both workflows are free, importable as JSON, and run on n8n Cloud's free tier. No infrastructure, no permission from engineering. Today I'll show you how to build them in an afternoon.

  ambiguousHeading: The Ambiguous Test
  ambiguousExample: |
      "It would be really nice if the export could handle more than 100 rows without crashing."
  ambiguousExplanation1: |
      Is this a feature request ("it would be nice") or a bug ("crashing")? The tiebreaker rule in the prompt handles it: if feedback contains both a bug and a feature request, classify as BUG — broken things take priority.
  ambiguousExplanation2: |
      If you disagree with that classification, you change one line of the prompt. Not a model retrain. Not a ticket to data science. One line of text. You wrote acceptance criteria, not code — and that's a product decision, not an engineering decision.

  heading: What I Learned Automating 170 Hours a Month
  items:
    - title: Automate the boring task first.
      detail: |
          The flashy use case is tempting. But sprint reports won me 12 hours back every two weeks — more than any clever integration I built.
    - title: Your database is the brain.
      detail: |
          Don't build a separate "automation database." Jira, Airtable, and Sheets already contain 90% of the data your workflows need.
    - title: "Automate the trigger, not just the task."
      detail: |
          A workflow that runs "when I click a button" saves time. A workflow that runs "when a deal closes" saves time AND removes you from the loop entirely. The second kind is worth 10x more.
    - title: Start with one.
      detail: |
          I tried to automate everything at once and ended up with 14 half-broken workflows and zero time savings. One workflow running reliably beats five in draft mode.
faq:
  heading: Common Questions
  items:
    - q: "Can n8n connect to Jira / Salesforce / my tool?"
      a: |
          Yes. Over 400 integrations — Jira, Salesforce, Notion, Linear, HubSpot, Zendesk, Google Sheets. If you use it, n8n probably connects to it.
    - q: "Is n8n free?"
      a: |
          Yes, self-hosted is free forever under the Sustainable Use license (open core, no workflow or execution limits). The only thing you pay for is the VPS where you deploy it. The cloud version includes a 14-day free trial without a credit card and plans starting at €24/month. The trial is more than enough for the workflows in this article; for continuous use in an SMB, self-hosted usually pays off from month two.
    - q: "What LLM should I use for the classifier?"
      a: |
          Whatever your company already pays for. The prompt works the same with Claude, GPT-4, or Gemini. The classification pattern doesn't change with the model.
    - q: "How is this different from Zapier or Make?"
      a: |
          Open source, self-hostable, AI nodes built in, and a visual canvas that lets you see the branching logic. Zapier is great for simple triggers. n8n is for when you need branching, AI, loops, and full control.
    - q: "What if the AI classifies something wrong?"
      a: |
          You change the prompt. Add a new signal word, adjust the tiebreaker rule, add a category. You iterate in plain English, not in code. And the Airtable log lets you review and correct.
    - q: "Can I download the n8n templates from this article?"
      a: |
          Yes. Both workflows are available as JSON files you can import directly into n8n Cloud (free tier). Download them from the "Import Workflows" section and they'll be running in 5 minutes.

  howToHeading: "How to import:"
  howToText: |
      In n8n, click the + button, select "Import from File", and choose the JSON. Then connect your own Slack, Airtable, and AI credentials.
