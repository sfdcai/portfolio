      How I generated 4,730 unique landing pages with real production data, a 14-table Airtable CMS, and DataForSEO as the decision engine. 2.26M impressions, 19K+ clicks.
  date: "Feb 25, 2026"
intro:
  hook: |
      In Spain's device repair market, nobody was doing programmatic SEO. Every combination of device, brand, model, repair type, and city was an untapped long-tail opportunity.
  body: |
      The thesis: if someone searches "iPhone battery repair Seville", a dedicated page should exist — with the real price, estimated turnaround, and photos from actual repairs. But hand-building thousands of pages wouldn't scale. I needed a system that auto-generated them from the ERP, smart enough to decide which ones to index and which to skip.
  context: |
      Amit Bhardwaj iRepair was my device repair business in Seville since 2009. Sixteen years, over 30,000 repairs. In 2024 I decided the website needed to move beyond a Squarespace brochure and start capturing the demand already sitting in Google. I built this programmatic SEO system as a competitive moat and sold the business in September 2025, at its peak.

  migration:
    heading: The Starting Point
    intro: |
        The business website had been running on Squarespace for years. No URL control, no canonical tags, no custom redirects. What was coming wasn't just a platform change — it was a triple migration: platform (Squarespace → Astro), domain (amitbhardwaj.co.uk → amitbhardwaj.co.uk), and hosting (Squarespace → Vercel/Cloudflare). The first step was documenting exactly what needed fixing: a 144-page technical audit, completed as the Final Master's Project for the Big SEO program.
    duplicateCallout: |
        Squarespace served the same page at 4 different URLs (www, non-www, trailing slash, .html). Google saw 4 copies of every page.
    audit:
      heading: The Technical Audit
      prose: |
          The first step was a full technical audit, completed as the Final Master's Project for the Big SEO program. 144 pages documenting every technical aspect of the website: from traffic baseline to the last meta description.
      baseline:
        - value: 23.1
          label: Avg. position
        - value: ↓ Declining
          label: SISTRIX visibility

          label: Lighthouse (mobile)
        - value: 33/40
          label: Items with errors
      findings:
        - title: 838 duplicate H1s
          detail: |
              The Squarespace template injected a hidden H1 on every page, duplicating the main heading. Google saw two titles competing for relevance.
        - title: "1,015 cannibalizations"
          detail: |
              Pages competing against each other for the same keywords. Home, categories, and models were stepping on each other in search results.
        - title: 869 structured data errors
          detail: |
              The LocalBusiness schema didn't follow schema.org recommendations. Google couldn't correctly interpret the business information.
        - title: 831 non-canonical pages
          detail: |
              Squarespace served 4 URLs per page without redirecting to the canonical. GSC reported them as duplicates without canonical.
      callout: |
          33 out of 40 audited technical aspects had errors. Only 7 passed. The audit didn't just diagnose the problems — it became the roadmap for the entire project.
    technicalDebt:
      heading: The Technical Debt
      items:
        - title: No canonical tags
          detail: |
              www vs non-www, with/without trailing slash, with/without .html. Same page, 4 URLs. 831 non-canonical pages in GSC. Squarespace set canonical but didn't redirect.
        - title: No custom redirects
          detail: |
              Squarespace doesn't allow custom 301 redirects. 266 historical URLs returning 404 in GSC. Impossible to map old URLs to the new structure.
        - title: No URL slug control
          detail: |
              The business taxonomy already existed, but Squarespace generated redundant URLs like /reparar-iphone/reparar-iphone-x. 15 URLs over 115 characters, 10 with uppercase, keyword repeated 3 times.
        - title: Duplicate content risk
          detail: |
              1,015 cannibalizations detected. 79 pages with thin content. URL variants without canonicals sent confusing signals to Google, diluting the domain's authority.
    migrationSteps:

      steps:
        - label: Full crawl with Screaming Frog
          detail: |
              The crawl identified 838 pages with multiple H1s, 266 URLs returning 404, and 1,015 cannibalizations. The mapping resulted in 1,009 redirect rules.
        - label: New URL structure in Astro
          detail: |
              From ~80 pages to an architecture of 480+ pages optimized for 156,000 monthly transactional searches. Clean URLs: /reparar-{device}/, /reparar-{brand}/{model}/.
        - label: 301 redirects in vercel.json
          detail: |
              Dedicated project (servidor-redirecciones) deployed on Vercel solely to serve 301s. 190KB of configuration in a single file.
        - label: Intent-based redirects
          detail: |
              Redirect national pages to local versions. Example: /reparar-movil/reparar-samsung → /reparar-movil/samsung/sevilla.
    redirectServer:
      heading: The Redirect Server
      prose: |
          The triple migration (platform, domain, hosting) required a plan to preserve the authority accumulated on the old domain. The solution was a dedicated Vercel project whose sole purpose was serving 301 redirects. One gotcha from the domain change: Squarespace wouldn't allow redirecting the homepage, which blocked GSC's change of address. The double hop HTTP→308→301 prevented validation. Fixed in an afternoon with Vercel Redirect Domain + Cloudflare Redirect Rules for a single direct 301.

              /reparar-movil/reparar-samsung/reparar-samsung-galaxy-a12 → /reparar-movil/samsung/galaxy-a12. Clean URL, same intent.
        - title: Brand → brand + city
          detail: |
              /reparar-movil/reparar-realme → /reparar-movil/realme/sevilla. The new structure added the city as a local signal.
        - title: Wildcard + catch-all
          detail: |
              Any URL not mapped in the previous tiers redirects to the homepage. Zero 404s for users and for Google.
      callout: |
          An entire Vercel project whose sole purpose was redirecting. 1,009 rules mapped by hand because Squarespace's URL structure didn't follow a uniform pattern.
    orderCallout: |
        Implement the redirects before requesting the address change in Google Search Console. Not after. The order matters.
    migrationCost:
      heading: The Cost of Migration
      body: |
          Every migration has a transition cost. 800+ pages took time to get re-indexed and key keywords dropped temporarily — "reparar iphone sevilla" went from top 2 to position 6. This was expected: Google needs time to re-evaluate a domain after an address change. Recovery came.

  opportunity:
    heading: The Opportunity
    body: |
        Spain's device repair market is hyper-local. People search by city, brand, and repair type. But most shops had generic sites — a single landing for all of Spain, if they had a site at all.
    points:
      - Thousands of long-tail combos with virtually zero SERP competition
      - "Clear transactional intent: the user wants a repair, not information"
      - No competitor in the sector was doing programmatic SEO in Spain (2024)
      - |
          The ERP already had everything: 867 models, prices, turnaround times, real photos
      - |
          The natural business taxonomy (device, brand, model, repair, city) maps directly to URLs

  twoTypes:
    heading: "Two Strategies, One System"
    body: |
        The project started with national ambitions, but Google had other ideas. Repair searches carry strong local intent — Google favors results close to the searcher, so pages without a city couldn't compete. The fix: a dual strategy. Local pages for Seville (where the physical shop sits) and national niche pages for specific repairs where location matters less.
    local:
      title: Local Pages (Seville)
      description: |
          Device + brand + repair combos with "/sevilla". Google ranks these higher thanks to proximity to the physical shop. They drive the most traffic.
      examples:
        - url: /reparar-smartwatch/sevilla
          clicks: 615
          ctr: 3.7%
        - url: /reparar-iphone/bateria/sevilla
          clicks: 581
          ctr: 2.5%
        - url: /reparar-apple-watch/sevilla

    national:

  architecture:
    heading: The Architecture
    body: |
        The system has four layers. Airtable works as a headless CMS with 14 tables and ~60 fields per table. The ERP feeds real production data. DataForSEO decides what gets indexed. Astro generates static HTML with minimal client-side JavaScript — only what's needed for UX (search, carousel), lazy-loaded.
    layers:
      - icon: database
        name: Airtable (Headless CMS)
        desc: |
            14 tables, ~60 fields per table. 6-level hierarchy: Device Type, Brand, Family, Model, Repair + local variants. Dual pricing (original and compatible parts), image inheritance, cascading social proof.
      - icon: wrench
        name: ERP (Production Data)
        desc: |
            Feeds Airtable with real data: before/after photos of actual repairs, verified customer reviews, up-to-date parts inventory. 867 models, 20+ brands, 15+ repair types.
      - icon: bar-chart
        name: DataForSEO (Decision Engine)
        desc: |
            Queries real search volumes for each combination. The "indexable" field in Airtable is driven directly by this data. No volume means no index.
      - icon: zap
        name: Astro (Static Generation)
        desc: |
            21 page templates. Generates static HTML with minimal lazy-loaded JS. 6 JSON-LD types per page. Image SEO with EXIF injection. Deployed on Cloudflare CDN.
  cmsDeepDive:
    heading: Inside the CMS
    body: |
        Airtable isn't just a spreadsheet on steroids. Here, it runs as a full relational CMS. The key: a 6-level hierarchy that mirrors exactly how the business operates.
    tables:
      - name: Device Types
        purpose: Root level of the taxonomy
        keyFields: "slug, name, SEO description, menu order"
      - name: Brands
        purpose: Brands linked to device types
        keyFields: "slug, name, logo, compatible types"
      - name: Families
        purpose: "Model grouping (e.g., iPhone 14 series)"
        keyFields: "slug, hero image (inheritable), brand"
      - name: Models
        purpose: Specific devices with pricing
        keyFields: "slug, family, image (inherits from family if empty), year"
      - name: Repairs
        purpose: Repair types per model
        keyFields: "slug, original price, compatible price, turnaround, indexable"
      - name: Local Variants
        purpose: City-specific pages for local SEO
        keyFields: "model + repair + city, adjusted price, availability"
    highlights:
      - title: Dual pricing
        detail: |
            Each repair has a price with original parts and a price with compatible parts. The user chooses on the landing page.
      - title: Image inheritance
        detail: |
            If a model has no image, it inherits from its family. Cuts maintenance without leaving pages blank.
      - title: Cascading social proof
        detail: |
            Reviews link at the model, family, or brand level. A review for "iPhone 14 Pro" shows up on every repair page for that model.
      - title: Bridge mode
        detail: |
            Discontinued repairs don't get deleted — they're flagged as "bridge" and redirect to the closest alternative. Zero 404s, zero authority loss.

    storytelling:
      heading: Conversion Flow per Page
      body: |
          Every page follows a conversion structure designed to take the user from discovery to action:
      steps:
        - Hero with dual pricing (original/compatible) + direct booking CTA
        - "Model-specific specs: camera, battery, device technologies"
        - Gallery of real before/after repair photos
        - Verified customer reviews linked to the model or family
        - FAQ generated from ERP data (real customer questions)
        - Final CTA with shop map and booking button
      example: |
          A user searches "repair iPhone 14 Pro screen Seville." They land on a page with pricing (€189 original / €89 compatible), estimated turnaround (45 min), 3 real repair photos of the iPhone 14 Pro, and 12 verified reviews. No navigation needed — everything they need to decide is right there.
    dynamicCopy:
      heading: Dynamic Per-Model Copy
      body: |
          Every device model gets unique microcopy generated from its real hardware specs. An Airtable field stores the technical specs (camera, battery, processor, water resistance) and a prompt generates a description that varies by model. An iPhone 14 Pro talks about its 48MP camera and ProMotion display. A Pixel 7a highlights its Tensor chip and computational photography. This isn't generic filler — it's copy that only applies to THAT model, based on real hardware data. Same template, unique content on every page.
      screenshotCopy:
        src: /pseo/ss-dynamic-copy-iphone12.webp
        alt: "iPhone 12 dynamic copy: real hardware specs generate unique text per model"
        caption: |
            iPhone 12 page: storage options, RAM, Super Retina XDR OLED display, Li-Ion 2815mAh battery. All pulled from the model's real specs in Airtable.
      pricingHeading: Live Pricing from the ERP
      pricingProse: |
          The same CMS that generates the copy also syncs repair prices in real time. Airtable bridges the ERP (where parts costs and margins get updated) and the website. Each model card shows a price range calculated from the min and max of its available repairs. When a price changes in the ERP, the site rebuilds with the updated price — zero manual intervention.

The user types "iphone 12 pro" and the system scores all 867 models: +20 if all words match, +30 for exact match, +10 if the model name starts with the query, and penalizes extra words in the model name. Result: the 6 most relevant models, ranked by score.
      detail: |
          The interesting part is that the search is context-aware. On the homepage it searches across all 867 models from every brand and device type. But on a brand page (e.g., Samsung), it only searches Samsung models. On a device type page (e.g., tablets), only tablets. The same component, with filter props (`filtroTipo`, `filtroMarca`), behaves differently depending on where it's embedded. Models lazy-load on first input focus and cache in localStorage so subsequent searches are instant.

  decisionEngine:
    heading: The Decision Engine
    body: |
        The system generates thousands of pages (well beyond the 4,730 that received traffic), but not all deserve to be indexed. If nobody searches "repair front camera iPhone 11", that page shouldn't compete on Google — but it needs to exist for the user browsing from the iPhone 11 page who needs exactly that repair. The key is separating SEO from UX. The decision engine queries DataForSEO for real search volume on each combination, and stores the result in the "indexable" field in <a href="https://github.com/sfdcai/amitbhardwaj-irepair/blob/main/src/lib/airtable.ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-primary/80">airtable.ts</a>.
    rules:
      - condition: High search volume (DataForSEO)
        action: Indexable page
        detail: |
            If the keyword has significant volume, the page is generated with meta robots "index, follow", included in the sitemap, and receives priority internal linking.
      - condition: Low or zero search volume
        action: Noindex page (UX only)
        detail: |
            The page exists for user experience and internal navigation, but carries meta robots "noindex" and is excluded from the sitemap.
      - condition: No service data in the ERP
        action: Page not generated
        detail: |
            If there's no real service data (price, availability), the page doesn't get built. Zero thin content.
      - condition: Discontinued repair
        action: Bridge redirect
        detail: |
            The page is flagged as "bridge" and returns a 301 redirect to the closest alternative. Preserves accumulated authority.
    stats: |
        The system generates thousands of pages total. Of those, 4,084 made it into the sitemap as indexable. 4,730 picked up impressions from Google. The rest aren't indexed but still exist for the user navigating the site.

      prose: |
          The pipeline starts by pulling data from Airtable. Fourteen tables, thousands of records — API calls need to be resilient. One generic function handles all of it:

        name: Dynamic Per-Model Copy
        desc: |
            Each device model has a field with its real hardware specs (camera, battery, processor). A prompt turns those specs into unique microcopy for each page. This isn't AI generating content — it's AI describing real hardware data. Every page reads differently because every device IS different.
    exifCode:

    cascade:
      heading: "Content Cascade: One Review, Six Pages"
      body: |
          The system automatically inherits content through the taxonomy. A review for "iPhone 12 screen repair" doesn't just appear on that page — it shows up everywhere it's relevant:
      example:
        - page: /reparar-movil/apple/iphone-12/pantalla/sevilla
          label: Model + repair + city
        - page: /reparar-iphone/pantalla/sevilla
          label: Device + repair + city
        - page: /reparar-movil/apple/sevilla
          label: Device + brand + city
        - page: /reparar-iphone/sevilla
          label: Device + city
        - page: /reparar-movil/pantalla/sevilla
          label: Device + repair + city
        - page: /reparar-movil/sevilla
          label: Device + city
      detail: |
          The same logic applies to before/after photos: a photo from an iPhone 12 screen repair appears on every page in that taxonomy branch. This multiplies unique content without duplicating or generating anything artificially. Each page accumulates more social proof and visual content as the business grows.
    stats: |
        26,000+ auto-generated images. 867 models with 18 variants each. 10,000+ real repair photos. Zero manual intervention. The 12 Business OS bases feed the entire pipeline.

    heading: Inside the Image Pipeline
    intro: |
        The previous section describes the pipeline at a high level. Here you can see exactly how it works: the actual overlay templates, the composition code, and what happens when you run it across 867 different models.
    overlayShowcase:
      heading: The Overlay Templates
      body: |
          Each repair type has a 384×256 pixel PNG overlay. The overlay visually represents which part gets repaired: a cracked screen, a battery, a camera... 17 templates total, each designed to composite over any device photo.

    compositionProcess:
      heading: The Composition Process
      body: |
          Each repair image is generated in 6 steps, fully automated with a Node.js script and Sharp.js:
      steps:
        - label: Download device photo
          detail: The official device photo is pulled from GSM Arena and stored temporarily.
        - label: Create 384×256 white canvas
          detail: Sharp.js creates a blank base image at 384×256 pixels with an alpha channel.
        - label: Overlay the repair PNG
          detail: |
              The repair template (screen, battery, etc.) is composited as the first layer on the canvas.
        - label: Center device at x=96
          detail: |
              The device photo is proportionally resized and centered at x=96, leaving room for the overlay on the right.
        - label: Export to WebP
          detail: The result is exported as optimized WebP. Each image weighs ~5-8 KB.
        - label: Repeat ×17 repairs + hero
          detail: |
              The process repeats for all 17 repair types plus a generic hero image at 256×256. Total: 18 images per model.

            - label: Composition order
              detail: |
                  Overlay first (repair template), then the device photo. Order matters: the overlay sits behind the device.
            - label: Positioning
              detail: |
                  The device photo is vertically centered and positioned at x≈96. This leaves visual room for the repair overlay to be visible on the right.

  reviewsPipeline:
    heading: Reviews Pipeline
    intro: |
        Reviews are the most powerful social proof on every page. But managing hundreds of customer profiles, syncing two sources, and cascading trust signals across the entire taxonomy requires its own pipeline.
    sourceSync:
      heading: "Source & Sync"
      body: |
          Reviews come from two sources: Google My Business (publicly verified) and internal post-repair surveys. Both sync to Airtable and normalize into a single format.
      table:
        headers:
          - Table
          - Source
          - Key fields

          - - Reseñas Internas
            - Post-repair surveys

    imageProcessing:

      body: "Every review with a profile photo goes through an automated processing pipeline:"
      steps:
        - label: Download photo from Airtable
          detail: The profile photo URL is downloaded from the Airtable attachment field.
        - label: Convert to WebP quality 95
          detail: Sharp.js converts the image to WebP at quality 95 to preserve facial detail.
        - label: Save to /bg/res/
          detail: |
              The file is saved with a semantic name: reparacion-{type}-{model}-{name}-{date}.webp

    codeSnippet:
      heading: The Actual Code
      body: |
          This is the real snippet from `generarImagenesReseñas.mjs` that processes each profile photo:
      segments:
        - code: |
              const imageBuffer = await fetch(attachmentUrl)
                .then(r => r.arrayBuffer())
              
              await sharp(Buffer.from(imageBuffer))
                .webp({ quality: 95 })
                .toFile(outputPath)
              
              // Write processed URL back to Airtable
              await base('Reseñas sincronizar Astro')
                .update(record.id, {
                  'imagen_procesada': outputUrl
                })
          annotations:
            - label: Dimension preservation
              detail: |
                  No resizing — profile photos keep their original dimensions for maximum quality in the carousel.
            - label: WebP quality 95
              detail: |
                  Higher quality than repair photos (85) because profile photos are smaller and detail matters more.
            - label: Bidirectional ETL
              detail: |
                  Airtable is both source AND destination: the photo is downloaded, processed, and the resulting URL is written back to the record.
    cascade:
      heading: Social Proof Cascade
      body: |
          Reviews don't just appear on one page — they inherit across the entire taxonomy. A review linked to a model propagates to every page where that model is relevant.
      points:
        - |
            "iPhone 14 Pro" review → appears on every repair page for that model, in every city
        - |
            "iPhone 14" family review → appears on all models in the family (14, 14 Plus, 14 Pro, 14 Pro Max)
        - |
            "Apple" brand review → appears on aggregated brand pages like /reparar-movil/apple/sevilla
        - |
            The cascade is automatic: link the review to the right level and the build distributes it

  repairedDevicesPipeline:
    heading: Before/After Pipeline
    intro: |
        Every completed repair generates photographic evidence: 4 photos documenting the device's state before and after. This pipeline processes those photos automatically and distributes them across the site.
    captureProtocol:
      heading: Capture Protocol
      body: "Every completed repair at the shop follows a 4-photo protocol:"
      steps:
        - label: Front before
          detail: |
              Front-facing photo of the device before repair. Shows visible damage (cracked screen, marks, etc.).
        - label: Front after
          detail: Front-facing photo after repair. Same angle for direct comparison.
        - label: Back before
          detail: Back photo before repair. Documents the device's overall condition.
        - label: Back after
          detail: Back photo after repair. Completes the visual documentation.
      privacyNote: |
          The `difuminar` flag in Airtable marks photos that need blurring: screens showing notifications, personal data, etc. Blur is applied automatically in the pipeline.
    imageProcessing:
      heading: Automated Processing
      body: "Each photo goes through 6 processing steps with Sharp.js:"
      steps:
        - label: Download from Airtable
          detail: The original photo is downloaded from the repair record's attachment field.
        - label: Resize to 1/4 resolution
          detail: |
              The image is scaled to 25% of its original size. Enough for web, cuts file size dramatically.
        - label: Conditional blur (sigma 8)
          detail: |
              If the `difuminar` flag is set, a Gaussian blur at sigma 8 is applied. Protects personal data visible on screen.
        - label: Semi-transparent white overlay
          detail: |
              A 30% white layer is composited over the background for consistent contrast and a clean look.
        - label: Export to WebP quality 85
          detail: |
              Quality 85 — lower than profile photos (95) because at 1/4 resolution the extra detail isn't noticeable.
        - label: Write slug back
          detail: |
              The processed filename is written back to Airtable so the Astro build can find it.

                  Scales to one quarter. A 4032×3024 photo becomes 1008×756 — perfect for web, drops file size from ~3MB to ~30KB.
            - label: Conditional blur
              detail: |
                  Only applied when the `difuminar` field is set in Airtable. Sigma 8 blurs notifications and personal data visible on screen.
            - label: Quality 85 vs 95
              detail: |
                  Lower quality than profile photos because at 1/4 resolution the extra detail doesn't add value. Saves ~40% file size per image.

  growth:
    heading: Growth Curve
    body: |
        Launched in October 2024. The first months were pure indexation momentum. After an initial peak in January, traffic flatlined from February through June — and it wasn't seasonality. It was a restructuring: the original version generated both national and local pages for every combination, but there were too many and Google clearly favored local intent. I redirected national pages to their local /sevilla equivalents, keeping only niche repairs in national format (like /cambiar-bateria-iphone-11) where specificity outweighs the lack of localization. While Google re-indexed the new structure, traffic stayed flat. Once consolidated, growth took off again — peaking in September 2025 at 2,193 clicks.

    insight: |
        From 202 to 2,193 clicks/month in 11 months. The Feb–Jun plateau coincides with the national-to-local URL restructuring — Google needed time to re-index the new architecture. Once consolidated, traffic jumped 62% in a single month (Jun → Jul). The system keeps running under the new owner.

        detail: Astro SSG with minimal lazy JS + Cloudflare CDN
    transition: |
        But these results didn't come from nowhere. The starting point was a Squarespace website with technical problems that needed solving before the programmatic system could be built.
  crawlBudget:
    heading: Crawl Budget Optimization
    body: |
        With 4,700+ pages, managing crawl budget is critical — per Google Search Central's crawl budget documentation. Google shouldn't waste time crawling pages that won't rank. The 700+ robots.txt rules add to the 1,009 redirects inherited from the migration.
    strategies:
      - title: Selective noindex with DataForSEO
        detail: |
            The "indexable" field in Airtable is fed directly from DataForSEO volume data. Pages without search volume get noindex. Not an arbitrary call — it's data-driven.
      - title: "Filtered sitemap (4,084 URLs)"
        detail: |
            The sitemap.xml only includes indexable URLs. Out of 4,730 pages with impressions, just 4,084 made it into the sitemap. Google doesn't discover the rest through this channel.
      - title: URL structure with 6 patterns
        detail: |
            Each taxonomy level has a predictable URL pattern. Google understands the hierarchy without needing to guess.
      - title: Contextual internal linking
        detail: |
            Indexable pages receive more internal links. City pages link to available repairs, models link to their repairs, and families aggregate their models.
      - title: Bridge redirects for discontinued items
        detail: |
            Instead of returning a 404 when a repair is discontinued, it 301-redirects to the closest alternative. 700+ redirect rules in <a href="https://github.com/sfdcai/amitbhardwaj-irepair/blob/main/vercel.json#L27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary underline underline-offset-2 hover:text-primary/80">vercel.json</a>. Zero authority loss, zero broken links.
    safeNoindex:
      heading: "\"Safe Noindex\" Pattern"
      prose: |
          Accidental noindex is one of SEO's costliest mistakes — one line can deindex thousands of pages. Here's how we prevented it:
      segments:
        - code: |
              {NOINDEXCUIDADO &&
                NOINDEXCUIDADO === 'Estoy absolutamente seguro que no quiero hacer no index por eso pongo esta cadena' && (
                  <meta name="robots" content="noindex" />
                )}
          annotations:
            - label: "String, not boolean"
              detail: |
                  A boolean can be true by accident (wrong field, default value, migration error). An 80-character Spanish string requires deliberate intent.
            - label: Double guard
              detail: |
                  The prop must be truthy AND match the exact string. Even if set to "true" or 1, the noindex tag won't render.
      callout: |
          Two years in production. Zero accidental deindexing events. The 80-character Spanish string did its job.
  urlTaxonomy:
    heading: URL Taxonomy
    body: |
        The site uses 6 URL patterns, each corresponding to a level in the business taxonomy. Local patterns (with /sevilla) capture local intent. National patterns (no city) capture niche searches.
    patterns:
      - pattern: "/reparar-{device}/{city}"
        example: /reparar-smartwatch/sevilla
        description: Generic device + city. The broadest entry point into the local funnel.
      - pattern: "/reparar-{device}/{brand}/{city}"
        example: /reparar-movil/samsung/sevilla
        description: "Device + brand + city. More specific, better CTR."
      - pattern: "/reparar-{device}/{repair-type}/{city}"
        example: /reparar-iphone/bateria/sevilla
        description: Device + repair type + city. High transactional intent.
      - pattern: "/reparar-{device}/{brand}/{repair-type}/{city}"
        example: /reparar-movil/samsung/pantalla/sevilla
        description: Full local combination. The most specific funnel entry.
      - pattern: "/reparar-{device}/{model}/{repair-type}"
        example: /reparar-apple-watch/se/bateria
        description: "Specific model + repair, no city. For national niche searches."
      - pattern: "/cambiar-{repair}-{brand}-{model}"
        example: /cambiar-bateria-google-pixel-6a
        description: |
            Direct national format. Captures queries like "change pixel 6a battery" with high CTR (5%).
    appleRoutes:
      heading: Premium Apple Routes
      prose: |
          We started in 2009 repairing exclusively Apple devices — people knew us for it. Apple has the highest search volume, and shorter routes reflect that priority: /iphone/14-pro instead of /reparar-movil/apple/iphone-14-pro. Shorter, cleaner, better CTR. A single boolean changes everything:
      segments:
        - code: |
              // Apple: /iphone/14-pro (short, clean, better CTR)
              const records = await getRecordsModelos(true);  // modoApple = true → CMSAstro(Apple) view
              return records.map(r => ({
                params: { paramMarcaApple: r.paramMarca, paramModeloApple: r.paramModelo },
              }));
              
              // Generic: /reparar-movil/samsung/galaxy-s21
              const records = await getRecordsModelos();  // modoApple = false → CMSAstro view
              return records.map(r => ({
                params: { paramTipo: r.paramTipo, paramMarca: r.paramMarca, paramModelo: r.paramModelo },
              }));
          annotations:
            - label: modoApple = true
              detail: |
                  A single boolean switches the Airtable view (CMSAstro vs CMSAstro(Apple)) and the URL structure. Same page, same layout, two routing systems.
            - label: Shorter routes
              detail: |
                  /iphone/14-pro vs /reparar-movil/apple/iphone-14-pro. Apple is the dominant brand in repairs; its routes deserve premium URLs.
  stack:
    heading: "Stack & Tools"
    body: |
        The stack was chosen for a specific need: generating thousands of static pages from a relational CMS, with minimal client-side JavaScript. Astro was the obvious pick for pure SSG. Airtable worked as CMS because it was already the business's Business OS — migrating to Supabase for a static site made no sense. DataForSEO was chosen for price and Spanish keyword coverage.

  lessons:
    heading: Lessons Learned
    items:
      - title: "Google decides user intent, not you."
        detail: |
            I started out wanting to rank nationwide. Google had other plans — it read repair searches as strongly local intent. Pages without a city got crushed by Seville-specific ones. The lesson: build the full infrastructure, but let GSC data tell you where to double down.
      - title: The decision engine matters more than the generator.
        detail: |
            Generating 10,000 pages is trivial. Deciding which ones to index based on real DataForSEO data — that's what separates pSEO with results from a thin content farm. Out of all possible combos, only 4,084 made it into the sitemap.
      - title: "The ERP is the moat, not the template."
        detail: |
            Anyone can spin up pages with AI. Nobody can generate real before/after photos, verified reviews, dual pricing (original and compatible), and turnaround times from historical data without an integrated ERP. Unique content doesn't come from copy — it comes from data.
      - title: Airtable scales better than expected.
        detail: |
            14 tables, ~60 fields per table, 6-level hierarchy. With retry and exponential backoff on the API, the build stays stable. The trick: cache reviews and skip redundant calls. For a one-person team, Airtable as a headless CMS just works.
      - title: National niche URLs deliver the best CTR.
        detail: |
            The /cambiar-bateria-google-pixel-6a format pulls a 5.0% CTR at an average position of 7.8. These queries are so specific they've got almost zero competition. Individual volume is low, but multiplied across hundreds of models, it adds up fast.
      - title: Generated content without production data is thin content with better grammar.
        detail: |
            The difference between pSEO that works and a content farm isn't the template or the AI — it's whether the data is real. ERP pricing, actual repair photos, verified reviews. This pattern applies to any business with operational data: e-commerce, marketplaces, catalog-driven SaaS.
      - title: |
            Your business taxonomy IS your information architecture — don't invent it, map it.
        detail: |
            I didn't design the URL structure from scratch. I mapped the hierarchy that already existed in the business: type → brand → model → repair → city. The Business OS already had that taxonomy in Airtable. The programmatic site simply exposed it to the world. If your company already has an internal ontology, use it.

faq:
  heading: FAQ
  items:
    - q: "Isn't programmatic SEO just spam?"
      a: |
          Only if the pages don't add value. Here, every page has real service data: current pricing (original and compatible parts), turnaround based on historical data, before/after photos from actual repairs, and verified customer reviews. This isn't AI-generated filler — it's production data from the ERP.
    - q: "Does it only work in Seville?"
      a: |
          Local pages focus on Seville because that's where the physical shop is, and Google favors nearby results for repair searches. National pages (the /cambiar-{part}-{brand}-{model} format) work without geographic limits and capture niche queries across all of Spain.
    - q: "Why no AI-generated content?"
      a: |
          Because the moat is real data. Prices come from the ERP, photos are from actual repairs, reviews are from verified customers. An AI-generated page might sound good, but there's no production data behind it. The blog did lean on AI for writing, paired with NotebookLM for each article's podcast episode.
    - q: "Does Airtable scale with 4,700+ pages?"
      a: |
          Yes, with caveats. The 14 tables and ~60 fields per table work well with a build pipeline (not real-time queries). The key: retry with exponential backoff on the API and caching frequently hit data like reviews. For live queries at larger scale, you'd want to evaluate alternatives like Supabase.
    - q: "How do you keep pages updated?"
      a: |
          When a price changes or a model gets added in the ERP, the data syncs to Airtable. The next build regenerates the affected pages. New reviews propagate automatically through the family-model cascade. No manual work needed for content.
    - q: "Why Astro instead of Next.js?"
      a: |
          For a fully static site where content changes infrequently, Astro ships pure HTML with minimal JavaScript — only interactive components like the search bar and carousel, lazy-loaded. Pages load under a second, Core Web Vitals are great out of the box, and Cloudflare CDN deployment is dead simple.
    - q: "What does DataForSEO do exactly?"
      a: |
          DataForSEO provides real search volume for each keyword. The result gets stored in Airtable's "indexable" field. If a device + repair + city combo has no search volume, the page is built but tagged noindex. It's the decision engine that keeps you from diluting domain authority with pages Google would ignore.
