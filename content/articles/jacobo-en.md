tldr: |
    A multi-agent AI system that handles ~90% of customer queries without human intervention, 24/7, for <€200/month. 4 agents + 3 tools, dual-channel (WhatsApp + landline). Built in <1 month on top of a 5-year Business OS. Sold with the business in 2025. All 7 n8n workflows are downloadable at the end.
intro:
  hook: |
      ~15 interruptions per day. Each one, a repair on hold. Every unanswered WhatsApp, a customer walking to the competition. I built an AI agent that handles both — ~90% of interactions, 24/7, for less than €200/month.
  body: |
      Not a chatbot with canned responses. An agent that checks real prices, verifies stock, books appointments, and knows when to loop in a human with full context. That's what Jacobo became. In this article I share the complete architecture and the production workflows so you can replicate it.

  theProblem:
    heading: The Problem
    body: |
        With 30,000+ repairs completed and multiple support channels (phone, WhatsApp, web), the bottleneck was clear:
    painPoints:
      - "80% of inquiries were repetitive: prices, appointments, repair status"
      - Every inquiry pulled the technician away from active repairs
      - Response times swung wildly depending on the day's workload
      - "Data lived in three places: Airtable, the calendar, and inventory"
      - Availability stopped at store closing time
      - Hiring part-time support didn't pencil out
      - |
          Customers reached out via WhatsApp and landline. The solution had to cover both with shared logic, not duplicate the work
    alternatives:
      body: |
          The constraints were fixed: Airtable was the brain (the Business OS had been the SSOT for years), I needed real tool calling against live data, and the agent had to cover voice + chat from the same backend. The only open question was which orchestration layer to use:
      items:
        - tool: Tidio / Intercom
          issue: |
              Generalist chatbots with decision trees. Can't check stock in real time or calculate dynamic pricing against Airtable. For a repair business, they're little more than an interactive FAQ.
        - tool: ManyChat (WhatsApp)
          issue: |
              Good for marketing flows, but no tool calling capability against an existing ERP. Can't verify stock, create work orders, or do context-rich handoff.
        - tool: Vertical solution (RepairDesk chat)
          issue: |
              No repair SaaS offered a conversational agent with natural language and tool calling against real-time data. The ones with chat were essentially forms in disguise.
      punchline: |
          n8n was the natural fit: workflow orchestration with webhooks, native LLM agent support with tool calling, and the ability to deploy each sub-agent as an independent, testable workflow. All wired into the Business OS already running in Airtable.
  architecture:
    heading: The Architecture
    body: |
        Jacobo isn't a chatbot with a long prompt. It's a system of specialized sub-agents, each deployed as an independent webhook in n8n, orchestrated via tool calling from a central router. Every workflow in this article is importable directly into n8n — grab them at the end.
    whySubAgents:
      heading: "Why sub-agents instead of a monolithic prompt?"
      reasons:
        - title: Testability
          detail: |
              Each sub-agent has its own webhook. I can test it in isolation with an HTTP call, without spinning up the entire system.
        - title: Independent evolution
          detail: |
              Changing discount logic can't break appointments. I can iterate on one domain without risking another.
        - title: Cost efficiency
          detail: |
              Not every sub-agent needs the same model. Appointments runs on MiniMax M2.5 (fast and cheap for parsing time preferences). Quotes runs on GPT-4.1 mini (precision for structured output). Right-sized models per task.
        - title: Platform-agnostic
          detail: |
              Sub-agents are just webhooks. They don't know whether n8n (WhatsApp) or ElevenLabs (voice) is calling them. Any orchestrator can reuse them without duplicating logic.
    agentsHeading: "4 Agents & 3 Tools to Rule Them All"

          - "Includes conversation summary, detected intent, and customer history"
          - Human gets full context before opening the chat
    memory:
      heading: Conversational Memory
      body: |
          Jacobo holds no state between messages. On every new message, it rebuilds context by reading the actual conversation history from WATI:
      steps:
        - label: "Already served?"
          detail: |
              A switch checks whether an active session exists for this phone number. If not, it triggers a memory reload.
        - label: WATI fetch
          detail: |
              HTTP call to getMessages/{waId} with pageSize=80. Retrieves the last 80 messages from the full conversation: customer messages, Jacobo responses, templates, broadcasts, and human operator messages.
        - label: 3-phase parsing
          detail: |
              Three code nodes transform raw WATI events into {human, ai} pairs compatible with LangChain. Filters out broadcasts, confirmation templates, and system events. A __reloadFlag__ allows manual memory resets.
        - label: Buffer Window
          detail: |
              The last 20 messages are loaded into the LangChain BufferWindow, keyed by phone number. The agent "remembers" past conversations: if you confirmed an appointment yesterday, Jacobo knows today.
      punchline: |
          This is what lets Jacobo pick up interrupted conversations, recognize returning customers, and know when a human stepped in earlier.
    debugTools:
      heading: Production debug tools
      body: |
          Two hidden commands to debug memory in production without touching n8n. "Borrar memoria" reset the customer's buffer, useful when a conversation got corrupted or the LLM entered a loop. "HISTORIAL" dumped the raw buffer JSON — and that's what taught us to sanitize responses: the LLM returned the full JSON to the customer if left unfiltered.
    pseudoStreaming:
      heading: Pseudo-Streaming on WhatsApp
      body: |
          WhatsApp doesn't support streaming. A wall of text feels like a bot; sequential messages feel like someone typing. The router splits each response on line breaks and sends each chunk with a 1-second delay via the WATI API. Result: the "typing..." experience with zero streaming infrastructure.

  deepDiveBooking:
    heading: "Deep Dive: Natural Language Booking"
    body: |
        The appointments sub-agent has one job: turn "tomorrow morning" into a confirmed booking with reserved parts. No forms, no calendar picker.
    challenge:
      heading: "The challenge: bridging two worlds"
      body: |
          The customer speaks natural language ("Thursday mid-morning, or else Friday afternoon"). The YouCanBookMe API speaks Unix timestamps. The sub-agent bridges the gap and finds the intersection.
    parseUrl:
      heading: ParseURL
      body: |
          A Code node that extracts the subdomain from the YouCanBookMe URL to determine which booking profile to use. Parses the query string for dynamic form fields (repair type, customer data). Different calendars for different services: sfdcai-citav2-componentes for component repairs, sfdcai-citav2-diagnostico for diagnostics. The subdomain determines the entire booking flow downstream.
    analizarDisponibilidad:
      heading: AnalizarDisponibilidad (LLM)
      body: |
          An LLM agent powered by MiniMax M2.5 converts natural language into a structured JSON array: [{date, start, end, exact}]. The system prompt contains 15 temporal parsing rules covering every real-world case. Includes a Structured Output Parser to guarantee valid format and per-session memory (sessionKey = phone/ycbmUrl) so the customer can refine preferences without starting over. If no explicit preference, returns the next 3 business days with full schedule.
      rules:
        - |
            Default ranges: "morning" = 10:00-14:00, "afternoon" = 5:00-9:00pm, "all day" = 10:00-21:00
        - "Plurals: \"mornings\" → next 3 business mornings"
        - "Explicit ranges: \"10 to 12\" → start=10:00, end=12:00, exact=true"
        - "Conditionals: \"or else Friday\" → adds Friday as alternative range"
        - "Rounding: 10:15 → 10:00-11:00 (1-hour block)"
        - Filters weekends automatically (Mon-Fri only)
        - "\"Mid-morning\" = 11:00-13:00, \"first thing\" = 10:00-11:00"
        - "\"After lunch\" = 17:00-19:00"
        - Today only included if ≥2 hours of business hours remain
        - "Relative dates: \"day after tomorrow\", \"next Tuesday\" → resolved to absolute date"
    ycbmApi:
      heading: YCBM API (3 calls)
      body: |
          Sequential pipeline of 3 HTTP Requests against the YouCanBookMe API. Each call depends on the previous one — no parallelization possible:
      steps:
        - label: POST /v1/intents
          detail: Sends the subdomain → creates a booking intent and returns a unique ID
        - label: "GET /v1/intents/{id}/availabilitykey"
          detail: With the intent ID → retrieves the availability key
        - label: "GET /v1/availabilities/{key}"
          detail: With the key → fetches all real available slots with Unix timestamps
    filterSlots:
      heading: FilterSlots — The Intersection
      body: |
          A pure Code node performing set intersection: LLM ranges × real YCBM slots. Converts Unix timestamps to Europe/Madrid using Intl.DateTimeFormat, then filters: localDate === r.date && localTime >= r.start && localTime < r.end. Output is an array [{date, timestamp, start}] that can contain 0, 1, or N slots. The most elegant node in the workflow: pure set logic, no LLM, no API — just temporal math.
    autoBooking:
      heading: Conditional Auto-booking
      body: |
          An If node evaluates slots.length and branches into 3 paths. The sub-agent has its own per-session memory: the customer can refine ("no, Thursday instead") without starting over.
      paths:
        - condition: Exactly 1 slot
          action: |
              Auto-confirms (zero friction): preparePatchBody builds form data with email, phone, dynamic queryVars, and comments → emailCheck verifies email exists → patchSelections (PATCH /v1/intents/{id}/selections) → patchConfirm (PATCH /v1/intents/{id}/confirm) → confirmarCita informs the customer
        - condition: Multiple slots
          action: |
              escogerHora groups slots by date and presents options to the customer with contextual instructions
        - condition: 0 slots
          action: Informs no availability in that range and asks for another time preference
    punchline: |
        The result: a customer writes "tomorrow mid-morning" and 3 seconds later has a confirmed appointment with reserved parts. No forms, no date picker, no friction. This is the difference between "I built a chatbot" and "I designed a system that translates human intent into API actions."
  toolCalling:
    heading: Tool Calling in Production
    body: |
        Jacobo doesn't make up answers from training data. Every response is grounded in real systems via 7 tools defined as HTTP endpoints:
    tools:
      - name: presupuestoModelo
        desc: |
            Looks up repair/accessory prices and stock in Airtable. LLM: GPT-4.1 for structured output precision.
      - name: subagenteCitas
        desc: |
            Manages availability and bookings via YouCanBookMe. The LLM parses temporal preferences from natural language.
      - name: hacerPedido
        desc: |
            Creates repair/purchase orders in Airtable. 3 nodes: webhook → create record → respond.
      - name: Calculadora
        desc: |
            Volume discount: more repairs together = bigger discount. Pure business logic, no LLM.
      - name: contactarAgenteHumano
        desc: |
            HITL escalation via Slack with escalation reason, deep-link to WATI, and full context. Works from both WhatsApp and phone calls.
      - name: enviarMensajeWati
        desc: |
            Sends information via WhatsApp in parallel. When the voice agent needed to send a link or quote, it did so via WhatsApp while still talking on the phone.
      - name: Think
        desc: |
            Internal reasoning meta-tool. The agent "thinks out loud" before multi-tool chains to reduce errors.
    waitMessage:
      heading: "mensajeConsulta: UX while thinking"
      body: |
          When Jacobo calls presupuestoModelo (1-3s latency), it fires mensajeConsulta first: an "I'm checking availability..." that lands before the sub-agent responds. Without it, customers saw 5 seconds of dead air and assumed the bot was broken. One UX detail, massive difference.
    thinkTool:
      heading: "The \"Think\" Tool"
      body: |
          Before executing a tool chain (check price → verify stock → offer appointment), the agent invokes Think to plan the sequence. Explicit reasoning before action cuts errors in multi-tool chains significantly.
    stockAware:
      heading: Stock-Aware Routing
      body: |
          presupuestoModelo's output determines what happens next. It's not a fixed flow: the CTA adapts to real-time availability.
      flows:
        - condition: Part in stock
          action: → Offers to book a repair appointment
        - condition: Part out of stock
          action: → Offers to place an order with supplier ETA
        - condition: Model not found
          action: → Clearly states it and offers human contact
  channels:
    heading: The Two Channels
    body: |
        Jacobo runs on two channels simultaneously. The key: both share the same sub-agent webhooks. Business logic written once, served everywhere.
    whatsapp:
      name: WhatsApp (highest volume)
      detail: |

            Meta-approved WhatsApp templates for appointment confirmations, order tracking and notifications
        - |
            Pseudo-streaming: splits the response into sentences and sends them one by one. The customer sees Jacobo "typing" like a real person

            Event Routing: 3 switches filter noise (system events, broadcasts, human operator messages) before reaching the agent
        - |
            Transparent Human Takeover: when a human takes control via WATI, Jacobo detects the handoff and stays quiet
    voice:
      name: Landline (voice)
      detail: |
          Aircall as Cloud PBX + Twilio as phone bridge + ElevenLabs as conversational voice agent. Jacobo sits on the Aircall phone system as a literal "teammate" with its own routing rules.
      highlights:
        - |
            Aircall → Twilio → ElevenLabs integration: calls came through the business Aircall PBX. When no one answered or after hours, Aircall redirected to a dedicated Twilio number connected to the ElevenLabs agent. For the customer, it was transparent: they dialed the store landline and talked to Jacobo
        - |
            The customer called a landline and talked to Jacobo like any other employee. NOT a web widget or an IVR with menus. It was a real phone call with natural voice
        - |
            High-quality ASR (provider: ElevenLabs, PCM 16kHz) + 7s turn_timeout + 20s silence_end_call to handle natural conversational pauses
        - |
            LLM: GPT-4.1 (temp 0.0) for maximum precision in voice tool calling. Optimized latency (optimize_streaming_latency: 4)
        - |
            Voice model: eleven_flash_v2_5, speed 1.2x, stability 0.6, similarity 0.8. Conversations up to 5 minutes (300s)
        - |
            Knowledge base with 3 sources (Google Maps, Amit Bhardwaj iRepair website, business summary) leveraging ElevenLabs' native RAG (e5_mistral_7b_instruct). Didn't build custom RAG: the platform offered it and it was high impact with zero effort. Pure RICE prioritization. n8n didn't need it: the WhatsApp agent already accessed business context via direct tool calling to Airtable
        - |
            5 shared webhook tools with n8n: presupuestoModelo, subagenteCitas, Calculadora, contactarAgenteHumano, and enviarMensajeWati. 20s timeout per tool, immediate execution
        - |
            enviarMensajeWati was the cross-channel magic: while talking on the phone, Jacobo sent links and quotes via WhatsApp in parallel using the caller_id as a dynamic variable. Customers loved getting the info on their phone while still on the call
    cocaColaAnecdote:
      heading: "Production incident: the Coca-Cola"
      body: |
          A customer was discussing a phone repair. Mid-conversation, he turned to order a Coca-Cola from a waiter. Jacobo heard it — and told him we don't serve Coca-Colas.
      diagnosis:
        heading: "Diagnosis: three signals the system ignored"
        items:
          - label: Volume
            detail: Dropped ~40% — he moved away from the phone
          - label: Spectral tilt
            detail: Shifted — off-axis voice loses high frequencies
          - label: Semantic relevance
            detail: "\"Coca-Cola\" had zero relation to phone repairs"
      takeaway: |
          Basic VAD isn't enough. You need addressee detection: acoustic proximity + prosodic analysis + semantic gating working together.
    missedCallRecovery:
      heading: Missed Call Recovery
      body: |
          If the customer hung up or no one answered, Aircall fired a webhook to Make.com which triggered a WhatsApp template via WATI with action buttons. A huge chunk of leads came through here: people who called, didn't wait, and Jacobo caught them. Since it pulled context from WATI, when they replied it already knew they'd tried to call.
    dualOrchestrator:
      heading: Dual-Orchestrator Architecture
      body: |
          This is the key pattern: n8n orchestrates WhatsApp, ElevenLabs orchestrates voice, but both hit the same sub-agent webhooks. A real microservices pattern applied to AI agents. The sub-agents don't know who's calling them. They don't need to.
    unifiedVoiceUx:
      heading: "Unified UX: One Voice"
      body: |
          Every PBX audio — welcome greeting, IVR menu, voicemail — was generated with ElevenLabs using Jacobo's same voice. When the customer presses 3 or no one can answer and the live agent picks up, the voice is identical. No break. And if no one picks up and Jacobo texts them on WhatsApp after the missed call, the identity stays the same. A unified experience from start to finish, regardless of channel.
      punchline: |
          "Press 3 to talk to me, Jacobo." That's the PBX introducing the AI agent in first person. The same voice that then picks up. An agent that announces itself.
      audioIntro: |
          Listen to the actual PBX. Jacobo's same voice across welcome, IVR menu, and live agent:

      heading: "Pre-filtering: Should Jacobo Respond?"
      body: |
          Before a message reaches the AI Agent, three switches filter noise and decide who should respond:
      steps:
        - label: Event Type
          detail: |
              Filters only real messages. Ignores system events, delivery confirmations, status updates, and mass broadcasts. Without this, Jacobo would respond to its own confirmation messages.
        - label: "Who sent it?"
          detail: |
              Detects whether the last speaker was the customer or a human operator. When a human takes control of the conversation via the WATI deep-link, their messages arrive as owner: true. Jacobo knows this and doesn't interrupt.
        - label: "Already served?"
          detail: |
              Checks for an active session. If a customer replies to a conversation a human was handling, but the store has already closed, Jacobo enters with an empathetic tone: "We closed at noon, but I can help you until we reopen this afternoon." Real graceful degradation.
      punchline: |
          This 3-node filter is what makes human-agent coexistence work without conflicts. The human can take over anytime. When they're gone, Jacobo picks back up with full context.

    roi: |
        The real return isn't just the cost saving. It's the technician who's actually repairing phones instead of answering them, and the appointment that used to fall through the cracks at 10pm — now confirmed automatically.
    benchmarks: |
        Industry benchmark: enterprise contact centers average 20-30% AI resolution rate (Gartner, 2025 AI Customer Service Report). The most advanced virtual assistants achieve 15% (Gartner, 2025 Hype Cycle for Customer Service & Support Technologies). Jacobo hit ~90% in a specialized domain. The difference: domain-specific sub-agents with real-time data access vs generic chatbots.
    exitNarrative: |
        Jacobo is still running 24/7 under new ownership since September 2025. The buyer acquired it operating — the best proof of a system: it runs without its creator. The architecture patterns documented here are the same ones I'd bring to your team.
  decisions:
    heading: Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
    body: "The decisions that shaped the system — and why I made each one:"
    items:
      - title: Multi-model (GPT-4.1 + MiniMax + GPT-4.1 mini) vs single LLM
        detail: |
            Each component with the right model: GPT-4.1 for the main router and voice agent (precise tool calling), GPT-4.1 mini for quotes (structured output), MiniMax M2.5 for appointments (fast and cheap for parsing time preferences). OpenRouter as gateway allows switching between models without rewriting workflows.
      - title: OpenRouter as model-agnostic gateway
        detail: |
            Switch between models without rewriting workflows, automatic fallback if a model is down. We evaluated Claude, GPT-4, MiniMax: chose by use case, not by brand.
      - title: n8n vs Make for orchestration
        detail: |
            Each sub-agent is an independent workflow with its own webhook. Make doesn't allow this modularity. n8n supports LangChain agent patterns, memory management and native tool calling.
      - title: Sub-agents as webhook microservices
        detail: |
            Decoupled, individually testable, independently deployable. The same sub-agent serves WhatsApp (via n8n) and phone (via ElevenLabs) without duplicating code.
      - title: Airtable as brain vs database
        detail: |
            The complete Business OS already existed in Airtable (12 bases, 2,100+ fields). Single source of truth for stock, prices and customer history. Build on what already exists, don't duplicate.
      - title: "Memory window: 20 messages per session"
        detail: |
            Balance between context and token cost. Sufficient for a repair conversation (95% resolve in <10 messages). Keyed by phone number for continuity.
      - title: Think tool for internal reasoning
        detail: |
            Explicit reasoning before multi-tool chains. Reduces errors because the LLM plans the sequence (check price → verify stock → offer appointment) before executing.
      - title: HITL via Slack with escalation reason
        detail: |
            The LLM generates the escalation reason and includes it in the Slack message: why human intervention is needed, what it has tried, and what the customer needs. Works identically from WhatsApp (deep-link to WATI) and phone calls. The human knows why they're needed before opening the conversation.
      - title: "WhatsApp first, voice second"
        detail: |
            70% of volume came through WhatsApp. Starting there maximized impact before expanding to voice. Voice (ElevenLabs + Aircall) reused existing sub-agents without duplicating logic.
      - title: Dual-orchestrator with shared sub-agents
        detail: |
            n8n for WhatsApp/web, ElevenLabs for voice. Sub-agents are platform-agnostic webhooks. Reusable by any orchestrator without duplicating logic. A real microservices pattern.
      - title: "ElevenLabs as \"teammate\" on Aircall"
        detail: |
            Jacobo integrated into PBX with routing rules: picks up on overflow or after hours. The customer calls a landline, transparent experience. eleven_flash_v2_5 with temp 0.0 for maximum consistency.
      - title: Aircall → Twilio → ElevenLabs (and the latency trade-off)
        detail: |
            The Aircall PBX → Twilio (phone bridge) → ElevenLabs chain worked, but each hop added latency: ~950-1,500ms mouth-to-ear. Twilio uses G.711 at 8kHz when STT models are optimized for 16kHz, forcing resampling with accuracy loss. Today I'd choose a direct SIP trunk (Telnyx offers G.722 wideband at native 16kHz and co-located infrastructure with sub-200ms RTT) eliminating the intermediate hop. The platform-agnostic sub-agent design would make this migration straightforward: only the transport changes, not the logic.

    tagline: |
        Jacobo wasn't a weekend hack. It was the inevitable result of 5 years building a proper Business OS underneath.
    steps:
      - year: 2019-2024
        event: Business OS as foundation
        detail: |
            Five years building a complete business operating system in Airtable: 12 bases, 2,100+ fields, real-time inventory, CRM with full customer history. Without this clean data layer, any AI agent would just be a generic chatbot making things up.
      - year: Jan 2025
        event: Training and deliberate design
        detail: |
            Before writing a line of code, I studied AI agent architectures. I knew I needed tool calling, that Airtable was the SSOT, and that the same backend had to serve both voice and chat.
      - year: Feb 2025
        event: First test version (monolithic)
        detail: |
            Tried the single-prompt-with-everything approach. Confirmed what I suspected: a monolithic prompt doesn't scale across multiple domains. This test validated the sub-agent-as-webhooks architecture, platform-agnostic by design.
      - year: Feb 2025
        event: Definitive multi-agent version
        detail: |
            My first AI agent, shipped to production in under a month. Full sub-agent architecture: each domain in its own workflow with independent webhook, central router with tool calling, multi-model per use case. The speed came from the Business OS already running underneath. Built alongside all other business responsibilities.
      - year: Mar 2025
        event: Voice channel (Aircall + Twilio + ElevenLabs)
        detail: |
            Jacobo as a teammate on the Aircall phone system, connected via Twilio to ElevenLabs. Reused existing sub-agents without duplicating logic. Validation of the platform-agnostic design: the webhooks served a second orchestrator without touching a single line.
      - year: Sep 2025
        event: Going-concern sale
        detail: |
            Jacobo has been running 24/7 since launch. It was part of the business sale as an operational asset: the buyer acquired it operating. Five years of clean architecture made this exit possible.
    bridge:
      - Jacobo wasn't an experiment.
      - 16 years building a business with my own hands.
      - "Systematize it until it runs {without me}."
      - "Jacobo was the piece that {closed the loop}."
      - I sold the business as a going concern.
      - "The systems I built still run today — under {new ownership}."

  lessons:
    heading: Lessons Learned
    items:
      - title: Sub-agents > monolithic prompt.
        detail: |
            I tested a single prompt with full context during design and confirmed it doesn't scale across domains. The sub-agent architecture was deliberate from the start: each piece testable, iterable, and independent. Changing discounts can't break appointments. Microservices logic, applied to AI agents.
      - title: "HITL isn't a fallback, it's a feature."
        detail: |
            A well-implemented handoff builds more trust than a bot that tries to handle everything. Customers value a system that knows when they need a person. The trick: the human picks up with full context, not from scratch.
      - title: "The CRM is the agent's brain, not the LLM."
        detail: |
            Jacobo isn't smart because of the LLM. It's smart because it queries real prices, stock, and customer history in Airtable. Strip away that data and it's just another chatbot making things up.
      - title: Start with the highest-volume channel.
        detail: |
            WhatsApp carried 70% of volume. Starting there maximized impact. When voice came later, the sub-agents were already battle-tested. We just plugged in a new orchestrator.
      - title: "Choose models by use case, not by brand."
        detail: |
            GPT-4.1 for router and voice (precise tool calling), GPT-4.1 mini for quotes (structured output), MiniMax M2.5 for appointments (fast and cheap). OpenRouter as gateway lets you swap models without rewriting. More FDE than "I use X for everything."
      - title: The Think tool prevents errors in multi-tool chains.
        detail: |
            Before checking price → verifying stock → offering an appointment, the agent makes its plan explicit. One reasoning step cuts errors in the chain. Rubber duck debugging, but for the agent itself.
  whatIdDoDifferently:
    heading: What I'd Do Differently
    body: "Jacobo ran in production for months. Here's what I'd change:"
    items:
      - title: Structured evaluation from day 1
        detail: |
            I bolted on evals after the system was already in production. Starting over, I'd define response quality metrics, intent classification accuracy, and HITL rate before v1. Retrofitting observability costs more than building it in from day one.
      - title: Direct SIP trunk instead of Aircall → Twilio → ElevenLabs
        detail: |
            The 3-hop chain added ~950-1,500ms mouth-to-ear latency and forced G.711 (8kHz) → 16kHz resampling. A Telnyx SIP trunk direct to ElevenLabs would give native G.722 wideband and sub-200ms RTT. I went with the long chain because Aircall was already contracted. Today I'd prioritize latency over convenience.
      - title: Vector store for memory instead of raw WATI fetch
        detail: |
            Fetching 80 messages from WATI works, but doesn't scale for customers with long histories and can't do semantic search. A vector store (Pinecone, Qdrant) with conversation embeddings would unlock "remember when you brought the iPhone 12" without loading the full thread.
  enterprisePatterns:
    heading: Transferable Enterprise Patterns
    body: |
        Jacobo was built for an SMB. The patterns scale. Here's what I shipped vs. what I'd add at enterprise scale:
    builtVsEnterprise:
      - pattern: Sub-agent routing with tool calling
        built: Router + 7 webhook sub-agents with intent classification and delegation
        enterprise: "Add circuit breakers, retry policies and per-sub-agent model fallback"
      - pattern: Multi-model orchestration
        built: |
            GPT-4.1 (router/voice) + GPT-4.1 mini (quotes) + MiniMax (appointments) via OpenRouter
        enterprise: "A/B testing models per sub-agent, canary deployments for new prompt versions"
      - pattern: HITL framework
        built: Escalation via Slack with full context and deep-link to the conversation
        enterprise: "Queue management, SLAs per customer tier, escalation reason analytics"
      - pattern: Platform-agnostic sub-agents
        built: Shared webhooks between n8n (WhatsApp) and ElevenLabs (voice)
        enterprise: "API gateway, rate limiting, authentication, endpoint versioning"
      - pattern: Observability
        built: n8n logs + Slack alerts
        enterprise: "Langfuse/Datadog for traces, latency and per-conversation cost tracking"
      - pattern: Voice infrastructure
        built: |
            Aircall → Twilio → ElevenLabs: functional, but each hop adds latency (~950-1,500ms mouth-to-ear). Twilio uses G.711 at 8kHz, requiring resampling to 16kHz for STT models, degrading accuracy
        enterprise: |
            Direct SIP trunk (Telnyx/Plivo) → ElevenLabs via SIP, eliminating the Twilio hop. Telnyx offers G.722 wideband at native 16kHz (no resampling) and co-located infrastructure (GPU + telephony in the same PoP) with sub-200ms RTT. For apps/web: direct WebRTC (Opus 16-48kHz) via LiveKit, no PSTN, achieving 300-600ms mouth-to-ear

              Tool calling against internal APIs, intent-based sub-agent routing, memory management. The same architecture scales to any agent orchestrator.
  promptEngineering:
    heading: Prompt Engineering in Production
    body: |
        No fine-tuning. For a repair shop agent, iterating on the prompt with hard rules is more pragmatic, cheaper, and faster than training a custom model. Every rule below has a production incident behind it.
    whyNotFineTuning:
      heading: "Why hard rules in the prompt instead of fine-tuning?"
      reasons:
        - Fine-tuning is expensive and slow to iterate. A prompt rule ships in seconds.
        - |
            The domain changed constantly: prices, stock, hours, promotions. A fine-tuned model goes stale in days.
        - |
            Rules are auditable. Anyone on the team can read the prompt and understand why Jacobo behaves a certain way.
        - |
            90% of production errors got fixed by adding one line to the prompt. Not retraining a model.
    businessHours:
      heading: Business hours detection
      body: |
          A JavaScript code node checked whether the store was open before each conversation. The result got injected as a dynamic variable into the prompt: when `isBH` was false, Jacobo shifted tone ("after hours I'll try to help you anyway") and stopped promising immediate human responses.

    mainPrompt:
      heading: Main router system prompt (n8n)
      body: |
          Simplified version of the production prompt. The original has 18 rules and additional variables. Each block here reflects a deliberate prompt engineering technique.

              ## ROL
              Te llamas Jacobo y trabajas en Amit Bhardwaj iRepair, tienda de reparación
              de móviles, tablets, smartwatches en Sevilla. Eres un experto comercial
              y en electrónica, que sabe diagnosticar los problemas que tienen los
              usuarios en sus dispositivos móviles.
          annotations:
            - label: Role prompting + persona
              detail: |
                  Defining ROL, name, company, and domain of expertise constrains the response space. Without this, the LLM wanders or invents services we don't offer.
        - code: |
              HorarioComercial={{ $('isBH').item.json.isBH }}
              - Si false → la tienda está cerrada: informa con amabilidad
              - Si true → responde con normalidad y ofrece ayuda inmediata
          annotations:
            - label: Dynamic variable injection
              detail: |
                  HorarioComercial is injected as a workflow variable. The prompt changes behavior without changing the prompt: a business decision (opening hours) controls the agent's tone.
        - code: |
              ## Objetivo
              Identificar modelo + avería → consultar stock → conversión hacia cita,
              pedido o presupuesto.
          annotations:
            - label: Conversion-oriented objective
              detail: |
                  The explicit goal ("conversion towards appointment, order, or quote") prevents the LLM from staying in technical chat without advancing. Without this, Jacobo would explain chip differences for minutes.
        - code: |
              Si el dispositivo no es móvil, tablet o
              smartwatch, dar ayuda general pero no invitar a dejarlo en tienda.
          annotations:
            - label: Scope limiting
              detail: |
                  Limits scope without rejecting the customer: the agent remains useful outside its domain but doesn't make promises.
        - code: |
              ## Instrucciones
              1. Identificar modelo y síntomas → llamar a "presupuestoModelo"
              2. Si varias reparaciones → llamar a "Calculadora" (array de precios)
              3. Tras respuesta de presupuestoModelo:
                 3.1 Hay stock → ofrecer cita vía "subagenteCitas" con urlCita
                 3.2 No hay stock → ofrecer pedido urgente vía "hacerPedido"
                 3.3 No hay presupuesto → facilitar urlPresupuesto
              
              ## Herramientas
              - "mensajeConsulta": mensaje de espera antes de consultar precio
              - "presupuestoModelo": lookup de modelo + avería en Airtable
              - "contactarAgenteHumano": escalado HITL vía Slack
              - "Think": razonamiento interno antes de tool calls complejos
              - "Calculadora": descuento multi-reparación
              - "subagenteCitas": gestión de citas vía YouCanBookMe
              - "hacerPedido": crear pedido en Airtable cuando no hay stock
          annotations:
            - label: Tool definitions as contract
              detail: |
                  Each tool documented with its exact function and when to use it. The LLM needs to know what each tool does AND in what order to call them. Without the contract, it made redundant or misordered tool calls.
        - code: |
              ## HARD RULES (nacidas de producción)
              1. Siempre llamar a Think antes de responder o pasar datos
          annotations:
            - label: Think tool as forced chain-of-thought
              detail: |
                  "Always call Think before responding or passing data" forces explicit reasoning. Without this, the agent would jump straight to tool calls without verifying it had all parameters, causing errors.
        - code: |
              2. No modificar URLs de "presupuestoModelo" (Meta da error)
              3. Un solo * para negrita (WhatsApp), no dos **
              4. iPhone + Pantalla → ofrecer SIEMPRE opción premium (12 meses
                 garantía vs 6). No está en web → derivar a humano si interesa
              5. Enlaces planos, sin markdown (Meta rechaza [text](url))
              6. Solo llamar a subagenteCitas TRAS presupuestoModelo
              7. Diagnóstico: 19€, solo se cobra si no acepta la reparación
              8. Correo: contacto@sfdcai.github.io/portfolio (no info@)
          annotations:
            - label: Hard rules as production guardrails
              detail: |
                  The rules at the end aren't style preferences: they're corrections from real errors. Each one has a story behind it (broken URL, confused customer, lost sale). They're the equivalent of regression tests, but in the prompt.
        - code: |
              9. No decir "agendar" cita → decir "tomar" cita
              10. No recomendar otras tiendas
          annotations:
            - label: Negative prompting
              detail: |
                  "Don't recommend other shops", "don't say agendar", "don't modify URLs". Telling the LLM what NOT to do is as important as telling it what to do: models tend to be overly "helpful".
    voicePrompt:
      heading: Voice agent system prompt (ElevenLabs)
      body: |
          Simplified version of the production voice prompt. Same domain, adapted for phone conversation. It shares the same webhook tools but the flow is more direct.
      segments:
        - code: |
              ## ROL
              Te llamas Jacobo y trabajas en Amit Bhardwaj iRepair, tienda de reparación
              de móviles, tablets, smartwatches en Sevilla. Sé conciso, amigable y
              resolutivo.
          annotations:
            - label: Compact persona for voice
              detail: |
                  The WhatsApp prompt has an extensive ROL with tone rules. In voice, brevity is key: the LLM needs less context to generate short, natural responses. Fewer system tokens = lower first-response latency.
        - code: |
              ## Objetivo
              Identificar modelo + avería → consultar stock → facilitar enlace.
              Solo dar detalles técnicos cuando el cliente no tenga clara la avería.
              Objetivo: que el cliente tome cita (si hay stock) o genere pedido.
          annotations:
            - label: Single-line conversion funnel
              detail: |
                  Same funnel as WhatsApp, condensed. In voice, the agent needs to decide fast: the conversation won't wait. One line with the full flow (model → stock → link) beats a paragraph.
        - code: |
              ## Instrucciones
              1. Obtener modelo y avería
              2. Indicar que estás haciendo la consulta → llamar a "presupuestoModelo"
              3. Enviar "urlSfdcai" vía "EnviarMensajeWati" (WhatsApp en paralelo)
              4. Si varias reparaciones → llamar a "Calculadora"
              5. Informar precio + disponibilidad + "te he mandado la info por WhatsApp"
          annotations:
            - label: Cross-channel UX
              detail: |
                  Step 3 is the magic: while the customer is still talking on the phone, Jacobo sends them the link via WhatsApp using the caller_id. The customer gets the info on their phone without hanging up. Customers loved it.
        - code: |
              ## HARD RULES
              1. No modificar URLs de "presupuestoModelo"
              2. iPhone + Pantalla → ofrecer opción premium (12 meses garantía)
              3. No decir "agendar" → decir "tomar"
              4. Cierre 18-22 agosto: si necesitan recoger equipo → mensajería gratis
              
              Número del cliente: {{system__caller_id}}
          annotations:
            - label: "Dynamic variable: caller_id"
              detail: |
                  ElevenLabs injects {{system__caller_id}} with the incoming call's phone number. This is what enables cross-channel: Jacobo uses that number to send WhatsApp messages to the same customer who's on the phone.
    citasPrompt:
      heading: Appointments sub-agent system prompt (n8n)
      body: |
          15 temporal parsing rules that convert colloquial phrases into JSON time ranges. This prompt powers the most complex sub-agent in the system: it bridges natural language and the YouCanBookMe API.
      segments:
        - code: |
              Eres un micro-servicio que convierte frases de preferencia horaria fecha y hora (español de España)
              en un array JSON de rangos.
          annotations:
            - label: Micro-service framing
              detail: |
                  Assigning the LLM the role of "micro-service" instead of "assistant" radically constrains its behavior: no greetings, no explanations, no questions. Just parse and return JSON. Reduces hallucinations to a minimum.
        - code: |
              REGLAS DE NEGOCIO
              1. Rangos por defecto:
                 – mañana = 10:00-14:00
                 – tarde   = 17:00-21:00
                 – "todo el día" = 10:00-21:00
              2. exact será true solo si el usuario da una hora puntual que termine
                 en 00 o 30 (ej. "lunes a las 10" o "martes a las 17:30" pero no
                 "miércoles a las 10:15").
                 Si menciona un rango ("martes de 10 a 12") ⇒ exact:false.
              3. Horas con minutos ≠ 00 ó 30 se redondean:
                 - Redondea hacia abajo al múltiplo de 30 min anterior.
                 - Crea un rango de 1 hora a partir de esa hora redondeada
                   (ej. 10:15 ⇒ 10:00-11:00, exact:true porque era puntual).
              4. La fecha actual es {{ $now.format('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm') }} (Europe/Madrid).
              5. Acepta varias peticiones separadas por "y", comas o punto y coma.
          annotations:
            - label: Domain constraints as rules
              detail: |
                  Business hours, 30-minute slots, rounding logic, and timezone are encoded as explicit rules. Without these, the LLM invented non-existent time ranges or 15-minute slots.
        - code: |
              6. Devuelve EXCLUSIVAMENTE una llamada de función con esta forma:
                 {"name":"slots","arguments":{"slots":[
                   {"date":"AAAA-MM-DD","start":"HH:mm","end":"HH:mm","exact":true/false}
                 ]}}
              6.1 Si la frase incluye "mañana" sin especificar parte del día,
                  trátalo como «todo el día» de mañana (10:00–21:00).
          annotations:
            - label: Forced structured output
              detail: |
                  Enforcing a specific JSON schema guarantees the output is parseable by the next n8n node. "EXCLUSIVAMENTE" is key: without that word, the LLM would prepend conversational text before the JSON.
        - code: |
              7. PLURAL ("mañanas", "tardes"): devuelve las próximas N=3 franjas.
                 Incluye hoy si la franja aún no ha terminado.
              8. Solo abre de lunes a viernes. Nunca sábado ni domingo.
              9. Conectores condicionales ("o", "o bien", "o si no"):
                 preferencias alternativas en el mismo orden.
              10. "A partir de [día]": todo el día (10:00-21:00) + N-1 laborables.
              11. N=5 por defecto.
              12. Día concreto: solo las horas de ese día.
              13. "Esta semana": todas las franjas laborables restantes (Lu-Vi).
              14. Plurales: próximas 3 franjas.
              15. Sin preferencia horaria: próximos 3 días laborables, todo el día.
          annotations:
            - label: Edge case enumeration
              detail: |
                  Each rule (7-15) addresses a real production failure: plurals, conditional connectors, "this week". Without explicitly enumerating each edge case, the LLM interpreted freely and generated incorrect slots.
        - code: |
              # EJEMPLOS
              Input: "mañana por la mañana"
              → {"slots":[{"date":"[mañana]","start":"10:00","end":"14:00","exact":false}]}
              
              Input: "martes de 10 a 12 y viernes todo el día"
              → {"slots":[

                {"date":"[viernes]","start":"10:00","end":"21:00","exact":false}
              ]}
              
              Input: "lunes a las 10"
              → {"slots":[{"date":"[lunes]","start":"10:00","end":"11:00","exact":true}]}
          annotations:
            - label: Few-shot prompting
              detail: |
                  3 input→output examples covering the 3 key scenarios: generic range (exact:false), multi-slot with "y", and exact time (exact:true). Just enough to anchor the format without overfitting behavior.
    iterationExamples:
      heading: Real iteration examples
      items:
        - rule: Don't modify URLs
          origin: |
              Meta rejected messages with concatenated URLs. A customer never received their appointment link because Jacobo merged two URLs into one.
        - rule: "Single * for bold"
          origin: |
              WhatsApp uses *text* for bold. Jacobo used **text** (markdown style) and the customer saw literal asterisks.
        - rule: Always offer premium screen for iPhone
          origin: |
              Customers asked after hanging up if there was a better option. High-margin sales were being lost.
        - rule: "Don't say \"agendar\""
          origin: |
              In Spain, nobody says "agendar una cita" (schedule an appointment). It's an anglicism that LLMs use constantly. Customers noticed.
        - rule: "Plain links, no markdown"
          origin: |
              Meta/WhatsApp doesn't render [text](url). The customer saw broken text instead of a clickable link.
        - rule: Don't recommend other shops
          origin: |
              Jacobo recommended a competitor when a customer asked about a service we didn't offer. Quick lesson learned.
        - rule: Creator attribution as lead gen
          origin: |
              A recruiter asked Jacobo "who designed you?" and it didn't know. Now the production prompt includes rules mentioning Amit as creator with a LinkedIn link. The agent becomes a passive lead generation channel.
  mainRouter:
    heading: The Two Brains
    body: |
        Jacobo has two independent routers sharing the same tools and sub-agents. One orchestrates WhatsApp, the other handles voice calls. Same business logic, two completely different interfaces.
    whatsappRouter:
      heading: WhatsApp Router (n8n)
      body: |
          The text brain: an n8n workflow with 37 nodes that classifies every message, decides which sub-agent to invoke, and orchestrates the response. Tool calling, prompt engineering, and all routing logic live here.
    voiceRouter:
      heading: Voice Router (ElevenLabs)
      body: |
          The voice brain: a conversational agent on ElevenLabs powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash, knowledge bases with business documentation, and the same tools exposed as webhooks. The customer talks on the phone and Jacobo responds in real time, checking prices, availability and managing appointments — exactly the same as WhatsApp.
  deepDiveQuotes:
    heading: "Deep Dive: Quotes Sub-agent"
    body: |
        The quotes sub-agent is the most critical in the system: every price inquiry flows through it. It uses GPT-4.1 mini via OpenRouter for structured output precision. Its response determines the entire flow's next step.
    challenge:
      heading: "The challenge: from free text to structured quote"
      body: |
          The customer writes "how much to replace the screen on an iPhone 15 Pro Max". The router needs a JSON with price, stock status, appointment and part URLs. The sub-agent bridges natural language with the Airtable database in real time.
    cleanModel:
      heading: CleanModel — Encoding tacit knowledge
      body: |
          Customers don't type model names like a database. They write "iphone 15", "iPhone15 pro max", "ip 15 pro", "I-Phone 15Pro Max". A human technician solved this with experience — they knew "the big black one" was probably a Pro Max. That tacit knowledge gets lost if you don't design for it.
      detail: |
          CleanModel normalizes the input: strips spaces, parentheses, hyphens, and lowercases. "iPhone 15 Pro Max" → "iphone15promax". This feeds a SEARCH() lookup in Airtable on the modeloLimpio field (also normalized), enabling fuzzy matching without relying on exact spelling.
      insight: |
          This node encodes tacit business knowledge. Without it, the agent would fail on most real inputs — because customers don't talk like databases. It's an example of why building agents requires domain understanding, not just connecting APIs.
    aiAgent:
      heading: AI Agent — GPT-4.1 mini via OpenRouter
      body: |
          The sub-agent's brain. System prompt with an ultra-scoped ROLE: "agent specialized in looking up prices". Includes Think tool for explicit reasoning before each tool call and Simple Memory (buffer window) with a static sessionKey.
      tools:
        - label: BuscarModelo
          detail: |
              Searches by modeloLimpio field in the Models table → returns RECORD_ID, Name, URLSfdcaiNueva, Cita diagnóstico.
        - label: BuscarReparacionesModelo
          detail: |
              Searches by RECORD_ID → returns 20 repair types with "Price, stock & appointment" (original screen, compatible, battery, microphone, speaker, charging port, rear/front camera, etc.).
        - label: Structured Output Parser
          detail: |
              Formats to JSON with schema: modelo, reparación, precio, stock, urlSfdcai, urlCita, urlPresupuesto, urlDiagnostico, idPiezaAirtable, idModeloAirtable.
      fallback: |
          If no match is found, the system prompt instructs: "you must keep narrowing the model to get more results, until you find the right one" — replicating a seasoned technician's reasoning.
    filtrarRespuesta:
      heading: FiltrarRespuesta — Deterministic post-processing
      body: |
          Code node that validates and cleans the AI Agent's response before returning it to the router. Validates that urlSfdcai points to the correct domain (if it doesn't contain "sfdcai.github.io/portfolio" → "NOT AVAILABLE ON WEB YET"). Then applies 3 field-stripping paths based on state:
      rules:
        - condition: stock === true
          action: |
              Strips urlPresupuesto, idPieza, idModelo — customer can book an appointment directly.
        - condition: stock === false
          action: Strips urlCita and urlPresupuesto — part needs to be ordered before repair.
        - condition: "precio === \"PRESUPUESTO\""
          action: "Strips urlCita and idPieza — repair not catalogued, requires manual assessment."
    punchline: |
        The result: a customer asks "how much to fix my iPhone screen" and in 4 seconds gets a real price, stock availability, and a direct link to book an appointment or place an order. No forms, no "let me transfer you". The sub-agent queries only the essential Airtable fields and returns exactly what the router needs to close the conversion.
    presupuestoPrompt:
      heading: Quotes sub-agent system prompt (n8n)
      body: |
          The prompt defines three tools (BuscarModelo, BuscarReparacionesModelo, Structured Output Parser) and a 4-step flow to return structured quotes with stock status.

              Devolver precio, disponibilidad de stock y siguiente paso recomendado.
          annotations:
            - label: Single-responsibility objective
              detail: |
                  One job: look up + return quote. The "recommended next step" (appointment, order, manual quote) lets the main router decide without another LLM call.
        - code: |
              ## HERRAMIENTAS
              - "BuscarModelo": busca el modelo del dispositivo en Airtable
              - "BuscarReparacionesModelo": busca reparaciones disponibles para ese modelo
              - "Structured Output Parser": formatea la respuesta en JSON estructurado
          annotations:
            - label: Tool chain pipeline
              detail: |
                  The 3 tools form a sequential pipeline: find model → find repairs → format. The Structured Output Parser at the end guarantees the JSON is consumable by the router without post-processing.
        - code: |
              ## PASOS
              1. Recibir modeloInput y reparacionInput del router
              2. Llamar a BuscarModelo con modeloLimpio
              3. Si encuentra el modelo → llamar a BuscarReparacionesModelo
              4. Devolver JSON: precio, stock, tiempo estimado, urlCita, urlPresupuesto
          annotations:
            - label: Explicit step sequencing
              detail: |
                  Deterministic step-by-step order. Without this, the LLM would sometimes skip BuscarModelo and try to guess the price. Each step conditions the next: zero ambiguity about what to do.
        - code: |
              // User message template (n8n injects the variables)
              Modelo: {{ $json.modeloInput }}
              Modelo limpio: {{ $json.modeloLimpio }}
              Reparación: {{ $json.reparacionInput }}
          annotations:
            - label: Variable injection via template
              detail: |
                  n8n injects modeloInput (what the customer said), modeloLimpio (normalized by the router), and reparacionInput. Separating raw/clean input lets the sub-agent search with the normalized name without losing the customer's original context.
  deepDiveOthers:
    heading: "Deep Dive: Tools"
    body: |
        Not every piece of the system needs an LLM. These three tools are lightweight workflows that each execute a single operation, simple by design: decision logic lives in the router.
    orders:
      heading: "hacerPedido: Rush Orders"
      body: |
          When the quotes sub-agent detects the part is out of stock, the router invokes hacerPedido. The workflow creates a record in the Airtable "Pedidos" table with everything the team needs to order from the supplier.
      nodes: Webhook → Airtable Create (Pedidos table) → Respond to Webhook
      details:
        - "Automatically flags \"Rush? = YES\" because the customer is waiting"
        - Links idPieza and idModelo for full traceability in the Business OS
        - "Adds note \"Automated order by Jacobo\" + customer comment"
        - The team receives the order in their Airtable view with zero manual intervention
    calculator:
      heading: Discount Calculator
      body: |
          Pure business logic, zero LLM. When the customer needs multiple repairs (e.g., screen + battery + back glass), the router sends a price array and the calculator applies tiered discounts automatically.
      nodes: Webhook → Code (discount logic) → Response
      details:
        - "Sorts prices high-to-low: the most expensive repair gets no discount"
        - "Position-based discount: ≤€50 → €15 off, ≤€100 → €20 off, >€100 → €25 off"
        - "Returns formatted summary: price without discount, discount applied, final price"
        - The customer instantly sees how much they save by bundling repairs in one visit
      segments:
        - code: |
              const precios = item.json.body.precios;
              
              // Validaciones básicas
              if (!Array.isArray(precios) || precios.length < 2) {
                  throw new Error('Debes enviar un array "precios" con al menos 2 números.');
              }
          annotations:
            - label: Defensive validation
              detail: |
                  The sub-agent doesn't trust the router: validates the array exists and has at least 2 prices. If the LLM sent malformed data, it fails fast with a descriptive error instead of returning NaN.
        - code: |
              // 1) Ordenamos de mayor a menor
              const ordenados = [...precios].sort((a, b) => b - a);
              
              // 2) Calculamos descuento por posición (el primero no tiene)
              const descuentos = ordenados.map((precio, idx) => {
                  if (idx === 0) return 0;        // sin descuento para el más caro
                  if (precio <= 50)  return 15;
                  if (precio <= 100) return 20;
                  return 25;                      // >100 €
              });
          annotations:
            - label: "Business rules as code, not as prompt"
              detail: |
                  Discounts live in a Code node, not a prompt. This guarantees determinism: a €189 screen + €45 battery always yields the exact same discount. Zero hallucinations possible.
        - code: |
              // 3) Totales
              const totalSinDescuento = ordenados.reduce((s, p) => s + p, 0);
              const descuentoTotal    = descuentos.reduce((s, d) => s + d, 0);
              const totalConDescuento = totalSinDescuento - descuentoTotal;
              
              // 4) Preparar respuesta
              const resumen =
                  `Presupuesto total sin descuento: ${totalSinDescuento.toFixed(2)} €
              Descuento aplicado: ${descuentoTotal.toFixed(2)} €
              Presupuesto reparándolo todo junto: ${totalConDescuento.toFixed(2)} €`;
          annotations:
            - label: Pre-formatted response for the router
              detail: |
                  The plain-text summary goes to the router and is passed directly to the customer. The LLM doesn't rephrase: it copies the text verbatim. The price the customer sees is exactly what the code calculated.
    hitl:
      heading: "HITL Handoff: Human Escalation"
      body: |
          The system's escape valve. When Jacobo detects it can't resolve (frustrated customer, complex case, out-of-scope request), it escalates to a human via Slack with full context.
      nodes: "Webhook → Slack (#chat) → Respond to Webhook"
      details:
        - "Posts to #chat channel with 🤖 emoji as avatar"
        - "Message includes: conversation summary, detected intent, and customer history"
        - |
            Deep-link directly to the WATI conversation: the human opens it with full context already loaded
        - |
            Jacobo confirms to the customer that a human will reach out, without cutting the conversation
    whatsapp:
      heading: "EnviarMensajeWati: Cross-Channel"
      body: |
          The bridge between channels. When the customer is on the phone with Jacobo (ElevenLabs), this workflow sends links and confirmations via WhatsApp in parallel. The customer gets the info in writing while still talking.
      nodes: Webhook → HTTP Request (WATI API) → Respond to Webhook
      details:
        - "Sends \"urlreparacion2\" template with the personalized appointment URL"
        - "Enables the voice agent to say \"I just sent you the link on WhatsApp\""
        - |
            The customer doesn't need to write anything down: when they hang up, the info is already on their phone
cta:
  heading: "Looking for someone to build this for your company?"
  body: |
      Jacobo handles appointments, queries real inventory, and escalates with context, all in under 30 seconds. The sub-agent architecture, tool calling, and HITL patterns apply directly to travel, fintech, healthcare, or e-commerce.

faq:
  heading: FAQ
  items:
    - q: "How much does it cost to build an AI agent for WhatsApp?"
      a: |
          The tools (n8n cloud, WATI, Aircall, LLMs via OpenRouter) cost less than €200/month total. The main cost is the time to design and develop the architecture. For a business this size, it's a fraction of the cost of a part-time customer service employee.
    - q: "What happens if the AI gets a price wrong?"
      a: |
          Prices don't come from the LLM: they come from Airtable. Jacobo queries inventory in real time. If a price changes in Airtable, Jacobo gives the correct price automatically. No hallucination possible on structured data.
    - q: "How does the voice agent on a landline work?"
      a: |
          Jacobo is integrated into the Aircall PBX as another "teammate". It picks up when no one else can or after hours. The customer calls a landline and talks to Jacobo with natural voice (ElevenLabs). It uses the same sub-agent webhooks as WhatsApp: same logic, different interface.
    - q: "Why n8n and not LangChain/LangGraph directly?"
      a: |
          n8n lets each sub-agent be a visual workflow with its own webhook, testable with an HTTP call. The maintenance barrier is lower than a Python repo. For this system's complexity (7 workflows, ~80 nodes), n8n's visualization is an advantage, not a limitation.
    - q: "How long did it take to build Jacobo?"
      a: |
          Less than a month from design to production. And it was my first AI agent, built in parallel with all other business responsibilities. The speed came from the Business OS already existing: clean, accessible data in Airtable, real-time inventory, CRM with history. Without that 5-year foundation, it would have been much slower. Jacobo was the inevitable consequence of a robust business operating system.
    - q: "Can you build something like this for my company?"
      a: |
          Yes. Jacobo's patterns (sub-agents, tool calling, HITL, cross-channel) are industry-agnostic. What changes is the data and integrations, not the architecture. If your business has structured data and repetitive processes, I can design a similar system.
    - q: "Is Jacobo still running?"
      a: |
          Yes. I sold the business in 2025 and Jacobo was sold with it — it's still in production serving customers today. That's the best validation possible: the buyer kept the system because it works.
    - q: "How do these patterns apply to an enterprise team?"
      a: |
          Jacobo was built for an SMB, but the patterns (sub-agents, tool calling, HITL, cross-channel) are enterprise-grade. At scale you add: circuit breakers, A/B testing per sub-agent, queue management for HITL handoff, per-sub-agent observability. What does not change: the architecture.
